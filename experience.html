            As a project manager in an internationalization company, I have the
            possibility to participate in amazingly interesting and varying
            customer projects. We help mainly small and middle-sized companies
            in their efforts to do business globally - in a different way than
            it usually is done. In addition to this, I even have the
            responsibility to drive internal projects within process and project
            management, economics and with a touch of HR.

            As a medical product coordinator/project manager, I was
            administrating the Notified Body business for the Finnish auditing
            team. In addition, I managed the customer projects and kept the
            wheels rolling by keeping the different threads in my hands. My
            mission was to build a well-working process in the business. I was
            part of the Finnish Notified Body team and worked even in close
            contact with Asian affiliates.

            Customized procedure trays are assembled to contain all the
            single-use components required for a certain surgical intervention
            and are always produced to meet the needs of a specific customer.<br />
            <br />
            As a local tray coordinator, I was responsible for the custom-made
            procedure packs daily routine work in Finland, ie. planning and
            helping the account managers to plan the contents of the different
            sets, keeping the contents of the sets correct, securing the
            availability of the sets and participating in the tender process and
            planning the business strategy for the sets in Finland. In addition,
            I participated in implementing global initiatives regarding
            components, regulations, and marketing material in the Finnish
            market. By creating processes and tools for the business and
            supporting the sales team, I strongly contributed to the success
            story of Mölnlycke custom-made procedure packs in Finland, from the
            very beginning to the high single-digit million business it is now.
            I had an international collaboration with the factories and the
            Nordic organization on a daily basis. My excellent organizational
            skills and a structured way of working continuously supported the
            whole team in reaching the goals.
