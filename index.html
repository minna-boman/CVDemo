          Welcome to my self-coded web-page! I want to introduce myself with
          some facts and curiosities.
          <strong
            >Why build a web page, isn't it enough with a LinkedIn
            profile?</strong
          >
          This page is actually a part of a demo that I have been preparing for
          the "Women code" (Mimmit koodaa) Bootcamp. Having worked long within
          medical devices business, I now plan to take my next career step and
          that's why I have decided to learn some new skills within software
          development. Let this HTML, CSS and (a small piece of) JavaScript
          excercise show you some of my newly-learned skills!
          <br />
        </p>

        <p>
          I hold an MBA degree in Entrepreneurship and business and have
          extensive experience within project coordination and project
          management, taking care of different tasks demanding excellent
          organization skills. I am happiest when I can fulfill the customer
          needs in a timely manner, whether the customers are internal or
          external. Keeping my promises and sticking to the project plan, yet
          being flexible for changes, I navigate to reach the goal.
