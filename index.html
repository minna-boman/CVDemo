    <p>Welcome to my self-coded web-page! I want to introduce myself with some facts and fun :-).
        Why web pages? These are actually a part of a demo that I have been preparing for the "Women code"
        (Mimmit koodaa) Bootcamp. Having worked long within medical devices business, I now plan to take my next career
        step and that's why I have decided to learn some new skills within IT. Let this HTML, CSS and JavaScript
        excercise show you some of my newly-arising skills!
        <br>

        </p> 
        <p>
            I hold an MBA degree in Entrepreneurship and business and have extensive experience 
            within project coordination and project management, taking care of different tasks 
            demanding excellent organization skills. I am happiest when I can fulfill the 
            customer needs in a timely manner, whether the customers are internal or external. 
            Keeping my promises and sticking to the project plan, yet being flexible for changes, 
            I navigate to reach the goal.  
        </p>
